# Remove Paywall Redirect Userscript
A lightweight userscript that bypasses paywall redirects while keeping you on the original website's domain. No tracking, no third-party redirects, and completely free to use.

## Features

âœ… **Zero Frontpage Redirects** - Will only redirect on articles
âš¡ **Lightweight** - Minimal code footprint (under 5KB) for fast execution  
ðŸ”§ **Easy to Customize** - Simple pattern matching rules anyone can edit  
ðŸ†“ **Completely Free** - No subscriptions, accounts, or hidden costs  
ðŸ“¦ **Self-contained** - No external dependencies or tracking

## Installation
1. Install a userscript manager:
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Add the script.

## How It Works
The script uses smart URL pattern matching to:
- Detect paywall redirect attempts in real-time
- Rewrite URLs to bypass tracking parameters
